If like me you enjoy using and seeing Photostream working you should love this tutorial it allows you to get an auto-updating Photostream stack in your Dock !


Prerequisties : 

- iPhoto
- Photostream activated
- 2 minutes

All you have to do is : 

	⌘+⇧+G

Then type : *(hint : you can use ⇥ key to complete a folder name you began)*

	~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub/

Once in the folder press :

	⌘+F

To launch the search, but don’t enter anything in the field, just leave it blank, make sure it’s not searching in « Your Mac » but in « subs » and then choose « Image » with « JPEG » type.

You just setup a search, but how to add it as a Stack ?
Notice this « Save » button dying to be pressed ? PRESS IT.
Name your search and after it’s registered just drag’n’drop the folder into your Dock.

Moreover this folder auto-updates with new photos even when you’re not launching iPhoto, amazing, isn’t it ?

Note : This works on Lion & Mountain Lion but only Mountain Lion allow to use Smart Folders as stacks in Dock so you can basically use the folder but not fancy display it in your dock.
