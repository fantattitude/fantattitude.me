I'm a huge fan of [Vlambeer](http://www.vlambeer.com) productions.

As they themselves say, they bring back the good old arcade among our over complex game experiences.

Back in 2010, they released [Super Crate Box](http://supercratebox.com) which is a fast paced arcade pixel styled amazing game praised by critics because of it's efficient concept and really good game design.

Sure it is a really simple game but damn it's so addictive !

First it was available on **Desktop**, then on **iOS** and now it's on **PSVita** and I must say, this is the best iteration Vlambeer produced.
Maybe you'll ask me why, well it's fairly simple. 

- Desktop version was amazing but you know it's not cool when you can't collect tons of crates in the train or bus.
- iOS version was cool because it fixed this last problem but touch controls are not optimal for that kind of really fast game and sometimes you could get some lags and get killed sadly !
- PSVita version = Perfect experience because of the huge screen + mobile gaming + ultra responsive controls (real buttons !)

I mean, I played Mac version, I bought iOS version and rebought it again on PSVita and I'm not sad because man this is one the best game I've ever played !
