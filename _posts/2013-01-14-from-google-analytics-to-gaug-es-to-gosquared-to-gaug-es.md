I'm a **data nerd**.

You might ask *"What does it mean ?"*, it means I'm kind of obsessed with data and even more when those data are related to me !

And then ? Then I LOVE web analytics services <3. And I tried three of them, and heres a quick set of opinions about it.

There's one service everyone knows about and it must be the biggest existing, [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com).

It's everybodys favorite web analytics service and it offers for free a lot of awesome functionnalities. Yet it's fucking cluttered with useless informations and configurations. It's a **real mess**.

Yet it offers so much possibilities that most people could not live without it but it's not who I am. I need something more polished.

Later I discovered [gaug.es](http://gaug.es), it's another analytics service with a different philosophy by the amazing guys at [GitHub](http://github.com).

It wants you to have all your important data one click away (where **Google Analytics** shows you lot of useless crap in lots of different places). It's also well designed and way more clear.

It also features a really neat **Live** mode which will show you real-time activity on your websites, it's like data nerd heaven =0 !

Probably a deal breaker for most people it's not free but really cheap **$6** per month for unlimited sites tracked until *100 000* page views.
When, like me, you are unpopular and shit, this seems like a pretty fair deal !

Lately I heard a lot of good things about [GoSquared](http://gosquared.com), another kid in the web analytics playground and I couldn't resist to give it a try. It seemed well designed like **gaug.es** but with way more features and a really godlike *Dashboard*.

Let's be honest I was disappointed. The aforementioned *Dashboard* just didn't work with me, and the lack of an iOS official app (which I forgot to mention but **gaug.es** had) is something hard for me to tolerateâ€¦ But sure it has amazing features !

But I think I'm just more interested in having something simple and straightforward like **gaug.es**. Even with my huge love for data.

And that's why in the end I came back to **gaug.es**, it fits me well. And I think the fact it's been made by the amazing guys at **GitHub** helps a lot.

*That was my opinion, but seriously go try them, those three are all amazing services depending on your personnality.*
