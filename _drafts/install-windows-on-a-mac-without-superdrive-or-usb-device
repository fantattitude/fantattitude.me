Recently I've come through a problem a lot of other people may have encountered, I had to install Windows on my Mac.

It doesn't seem to be that painful to do I must say, but what if you don't have a Superdrive in your Macbook and no USB key and no external DVD drive ? Because you know like me lot of people like to upgrade their Mac by replacing the Superdrive by a HDD or SSD.

So are you fucked ?

No, not really, there's a way to do it even without all those stuff. You just need your Mac, VMWare Fusion and a Windows image (iso).

1. First thing to do is to make sure you have VMWare Fusion and the Windows image
2. Now launch BootCamp Assistant on your Mac and select the drive where you want to put your damn Windows installation.
3.
