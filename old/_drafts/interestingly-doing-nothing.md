It's not the first time I feel like I'm doing nothing worthwhile of my life. These last couple of months I've been doing a number of things, like continuing the development of an app that have been following me for years (A pok√©dex for iOS), learning japanese, making a list of all the games I ever played, trying to get into game programming, chiptune music creation, open source libraries, writing things, politics and all. 

All of these things I never completed.
All of these things now here and I'm wondering if it'll change anything.

I buy things to feel alive but I'm never really truly satisfied.

My work feels more and more stressful and I'm constantly thinking about what I'm missing by working in a huge company.
